    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>The problem of cooperation has been a target of many studies, and some of the most complex dilemmas arise when we deal with groups repeatedly interacting by means of a <italic>Public Goods Game</italic> (<bold>PGG</bold>), where individuals may contribute to a common pool, subsequently sharing the resources. Here we study generalized direct group reciprocity by incorporating the complete set of reactive strategies, where action is dictated by what happened in the previous round. We compute the pervasiveness in time of each possible reactive strategy, and find a ubiquitous strategy profile that prevails throughout evolution, independently of group size and specific <bold>PGG</bold> parameters, proving also robust in the presence of errors. This strategy, that we call <italic>All-Or-None</italic> (<bold>AoN</bold>), consists in cooperating only after a round of unanimous group behavior (cooperation or defection); not only is it conceptually very simple, it also ensures that cooperation can self-sustain in a population. <bold>AoN</bold> contains core principles found, e.g., in the repeated 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma, in which case it reduces to the famous <italic>Win-Stay-Lose-Shift</italic> strategy.</p>},
